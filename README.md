**Data Quality KPI Dashboard – Power BI**

**Project Overview**

Manufacturing industries rely on accurate data to track machine performance and operational efficiency. This Power BI dashboard focuses on data quality KPIs by identifying missing records, downtime trends, and utilization gaps across multiple machines.

This dashboard is designed for location managers and decision-makers to quickly assess data inconsistencies and machine performance, enabling better decision-making and process optimization.

**Project Objectives**

Ensure data accuracy by detecting missing records in key machine parameters.

Monitor machine performance based on downtime, utilization, repair costs, and product quality.

Enable drill-through analysis for detailed machine-level insights.

Provide interactive visuals and slicers to filter data for a granular view.
